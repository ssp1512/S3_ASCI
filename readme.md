# Disaster Management Tool with Weather Prediction using Machine Learning



The Disaster Management Tool with Weather Prediction is a software application that leverages machine learning models to predict weather conditions and assist in disaster management planning. This tool aims to provide timely and accurate weather predictions, allowing authorities and emergency responders to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of disasters.

## Features

- **Weather Prediction:** The tool integrates advanced machine learning models to predict various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation for a specific location and time frame.

- **Disaster Alerts:** Based on the weather predictions, the tool generates alerts and notifications for potential disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, heavy rainfall, and extreme temperatures.

- **Ressillence Shelter:** The tool offers a geographical map interface that displays real-time availble shelter information. 

- **Mesh Communication:** Communicatiupn platdform deployment with mesh technlologies.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to emergency responders, local authorities, and citizens with varying levels of technical expertise.
